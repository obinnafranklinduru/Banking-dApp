# Decentralised Banking System

An overview of the smart contract and front-end. The code includes a smart contract called "Bank" that facilitates the deposit and withdrawal of ERC20 tokens and Ether. The front-end code interacts with the smart contract to provide a user interface for users to interact with the Bank contract.

## Smart Contract - Bank

The "Bank" smart contract allows users to deposit and withdraw ERC20 tokens and Ether. It includes functions for whitelisting tokens, depositing tokens, and withdrawing tokens and Ether. The contract also includes mappings to store token balances and whitelisted token addresses.

## Front-end

The front-end code provides a user interface for interacting with the bank's smart contract. It allows users to deposit and withdraw tokens and Ether, view token balances, and manage whitelisted tokens. The front-end dapp has not been built yet.

## Technologies Used

The code in this repository utilizes the following technologies:

- Solidity: The programming language used for writing smart contracts.
- OpenZeppelin: A library for secure smart contract development.
- HTML: The markup language used for structuring the front-end user interface.
- CSS: The styling language used for designing the front-end user interface.
- JavaScript: The programming language used for adding interactivity to the front-end.

## How to Use

1. Deploy the Bank smart contract to a supported blockchain network (e.g., Ethereum).
2. Configure the deployed contract address in the front-end code (`script.js` file).
3. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to access the user interface.
4. Connect a compatible web3-enabled wallet (e.g., MetaMask) to the web browser.
5. Use the provided user interface to interact with the Bank contract, depositing and withdrawing tokens and Ether.
